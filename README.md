# ML-optimization

This repository contains some Google Colab or Jupyter notebooks where I implement optimization algorithms from scratch to train regression models. I suggest the Convex Optimization book from Boyd and Vandenberghe if you want to learn about some optimization techniques. 

My main purpose in learning about optimization techniques is to better understand how models are trained in practice and how different techniques/algorithms can affect convergence.
